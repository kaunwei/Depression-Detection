# Depression-Detection
The Smart Mental Health Support System for Depression Detection and Therapy (SMHSDDT) will be used for the early detection of depression and will provide mental health support and treatment. Early identification and intervention are really important to ensure effective support so the people with mental health problems can be quickly identified and helped to recover. The proposed system uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze text data. The RNN model is trained on various data containing emotional expressions. The study aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of depression detection using machine learning techniques, especially RNNs and also suggests some suggestions to overcome depression and display a mental health score through a user-friendly chat. The results of this study can significantly contribute to the development of scalable and accessible mental health support systems. The integration of technologies into mental health holds promise for early intervention and prevention, which ultimately promotes a supportive and inclusive environment for human well-being.
